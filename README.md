# Habbo Username Checker
A script that allows you to check the availability of multiple Habbo usernames at once on different servers. You can select the server you want to check and upload a txt file containing the list of usernames to check. The script will then check the availability of each username and return the results. It also supports multi-language servers like: habbo.com, habbo.com.tr, habbo.de, habbo.fr, habbo.fi, habbo.it, habbo.nl, habbo.es, habbo.com.br.

It's a simple and clear explanation of what the script does, feel free to edit it as you see fit, or add more details or features.
